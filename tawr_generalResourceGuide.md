# Doing Text Analysis with R - Some General Resources


### Books on Text Analysis and R

- Jockers, Matthew L. *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature. Quantitative Methods in the Humanities and Social Sciences*. Springer International Publishing : Imprint: Springer, 2014.
  - Available as an e-book via [Purdue Libraries](https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA51683474750001081&amp;context=L&amp;vid=PURDUE&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US). A zip file with related materials can be found at [the author's website](http://www.matthewjockers.net/text-analysis-with-r-for-students-of-literature/). The first session of our workshop series was adapted from chapters 2 through 4 of this book.

- Silge, Julia, and David Robinson. *Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach*. First ed. O'Reilly Media, 2017.
  - Available as an e-book via [Purdue Libraries](https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA51719072750001081&amp;context=L&amp;vid=PURDUE&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US). This book teaches text mining and analysis using the data principles and R packages associated with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). (See also *R for Data Science*, below.) Although not exclusively humanities-focused, the book does use many literary and related examples.

- Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton. *Humanities Data in R Exploring Networks, Geospatial Data, Images, and Text*. Quantitative Methods in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Springer International Publishing: Imprint: Springer, 2015.
  - Available as an e-book via [Purdue Libraries](https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA51683475900001081&amp;context=L&amp;vid=PURDUE&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US). This book teaches how to use R in a variety of research tasks. Text analysis is explored in Chapters 9 and 10.

- Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. *R for Data Science : Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data*. First ed. O'Reilly Media, 2016.
  - Available as an e-book via [Purdue Libraries](https://purdue-primo-prod.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=PURDUE_ALMA51717758410001081&context=L&vid=PURDUE&search_scope=everything&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US). This text provides a foundational introduction to the use of R for data analysis via "tidy" data principles and methods. Not humanities-focused but generally approachable. Also provides a solid introduction to data visualization with R.

### General Online Resources for Text Analysis and DH methodologies

- [TAPoR 3](http://tapor.ca/home): A portal for discovering tools related to different aspects of Text Analysis.
- [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/): &quot;A web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts.&quot; A good beginner-friendly starting point for exploring different aspects of text analysis.
- [Statistical Methods for Studying Literature Using R](https://daedalus.umkc.edu/StatisticalMethods/index.html) by Jeff Rydberg-Cox
- [Teaching Yourself to Code in DH](http://scottbot.net/teaching-yourself-to-code-in-dh/): A thorough list of a wide range of DH and digital scholarship resources – especially books and online tutorials – with an emphasis on programming. Compiled by Scott Weinbart.

### General Online Resources for Exploring R

- [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/): When you log in to RStudio Cloud, you'll see links to different R learning opportunities (including DataCamp). RStudio also has an active and supportive [community forum](https://community.rstudio.com/) where people post questions and discuss issues.
- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/): An R-focused community that fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. It keeps a searchable list of vetted R packages that address a range of research needs. Although science-focused, humanities needs are increasingly represented.
- [Awesome R](https://awesome-r.com/): A curated list of R packages organized by area of interest. In particular, see the sections on [Natural Language Processing](https://awesome-r.com/#awesome-r-natural-language-processing).
